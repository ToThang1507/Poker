## How it Works
This website uses Socket.io to establish real-time communication between the client and the server. When a player joins a game room, they are assigned a unique ID, which is used to communicate with other players in the same game room.

The server-side code is built using Node.js and Express.js. It handles HTTP requests and serves the client-side code and static files. The client-side code is built using React and communicates with the server using Socket.io.
